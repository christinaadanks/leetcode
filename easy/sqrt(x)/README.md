# sqrt(x)
given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the square root of `x`.

since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**note:** you are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

#### example 1:
> **input:** x = 4  
> **output:** 2

#### example 2:
> **input:** x = 8  
> **output:** 2  
> **explanation:** the square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

#### constraints:
* `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
