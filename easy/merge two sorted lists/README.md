# merge two sorted lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

#### example 1:
> **input:** l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]  
> **output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4]

#### example 2:
> **input:** l1 = [], l2 = []  
> **output:** []

#### example 3:
> **input:** l1 = [], l2 = [0]  
> **output:** [0]

#### constraints:
* the number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
