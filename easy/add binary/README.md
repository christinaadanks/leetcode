# add binary
Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

#### example 1:
> **Input:** a = "11", b = "1"  
> **Output:** "100"

#### example 2:
> **Input:** a = "1010", b = "1011"  
> **Output:** "10101"

#### constraints:
* `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
* `a` and `b` consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
* Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
