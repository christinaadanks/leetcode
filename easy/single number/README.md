# single number
given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. find that single one.

you must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

#### example 1:
> **input:** nums = [2,2,1]  
> **output:** 1 

#### example 2:
> **input:** nums = [4,1,2,1,2]  
> **output:** 4

#### example 3:
> **input:** nums = [1]  
> **output:** 1

#### constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
* each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
