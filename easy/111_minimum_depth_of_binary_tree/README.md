# 111. minimum depth of binary tree
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

#### example 1:
> **input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
> **output:** 2

#### example 2:
> **input:** root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]  
> **output:** 5

#### constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 105]`.
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
