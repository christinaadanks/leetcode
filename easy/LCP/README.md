# LCP
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.  
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

#### example 1:
> **input:** strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]  
> **output:** "fl"

##### example 2:
> **input:** strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]  
> **output:** ""  
> **explanation:** There is no common prefix among the input strings.

#### constraints:
* `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
* `strs[i]` consists of only lower-case English letters.
